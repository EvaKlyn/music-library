# Thematic Sets

These folders each contain a set of tracks calibrated to certain moods and themes. They share vibes more heavily or were made to be used together essentially.

## Sets

- /aerofuture*: jungle and dnb tracks with a futuristic bent.
- /chiprock*: guitar-heavy chiptune stuff.
- /wolves*: for use with Luke Gearing's *Wolves Upon The Coast*. 

*Also available on Bandcamp if you want to support me and get lossless versions.
