# Thematic Sets

These folders each contain a set of tracks calibrated to certain moods and themes. They share vibes more heavily or were made to be used together essentially.

## Sets

- /aerofuture*: jungle and dnb tracks with a futuristic bent.
- /chiprock*: guitar-heavy chiptune stuff.
- /raidboss: good music for fighting one big bad dude.
- /traveller*: music for classic (or modern, or whatever) traveller.
- /wolves*: for use with Luke Gearing's *Wolves Upon The Coast*.
