# Eva K's Music Library

I'm Eva, a musician, developer, and TTRPG enthusiast. This is a collection of music I've made over the past while that is fit for use in projects like TTRPGs, video, or whatever else. All I ask is that you credit me somewhere and aren't a hateful person if you're using my work publicly. (If you felt as if I may be attacking you by asking that you aren't hateful, you should probably not use my work ðŸ˜‰).

The music here is all electronic of some kind, mostly mangling samples and recordings of acoustic instruments. My appendix N includes Kota Hoshino's soundtrack for *Evergrace* by From Software and Takayuki Aihara and Nobuyoshi Sano's soundtrack for *Drakengard* by Cavia. I'll be updating this repository as I create more fitting music.

If you'd like to support my work, I maintain a [Bandcamp Account](https://eva-k.bandcamp.com/). I also have a [website](https://evakmusic.com/).
