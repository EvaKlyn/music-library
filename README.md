# Eva K's Music Library

I'm Eva, a musician, developer, and TTRPG enthusiast. This is a collection of music I've made over the past while that is fit for use in projects like TTRPGs, video, or whatever else. If you're using my work publicly, all I ask is that you credit me somewhere decently obvious and aren't a hateful person (If you felt as if I may be attacking you by asking that you aren't hateful, you should probably not use my work ðŸ˜‰).

The music here is all electronic of some kind, mostly mangling samples and recordings of acoustic instruments.
